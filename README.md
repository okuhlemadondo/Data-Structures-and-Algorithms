# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is dedicated to my journey of mastering data structures and algorithms through hands-on practice and skill development. It showcases:

- **Fundamental Implementations:** Core data structures like Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, and more.
- **Algorithmic Solutions:** Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, and Graph Traversals.
- **Problem-Solving Practice:** Solutions to coding challenges and problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and Codeforces.
- **Showcase of Skills:** Real-world examples and mini-projects applying DSA concepts in meaningful ways.

This repository serves as a portfolio of my growth in problem-solving and coding efficiency. Feedback is appreciated as I continue to refine my skills!
